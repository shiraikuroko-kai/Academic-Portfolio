# Academic & Project Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my portfolio.

This repository serves as a curated collection of my most significant data science and software development projects from my undergraduate studies and the period of self-study that followed. It is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of my technical skills, my problem-solving approach, and my growth as an analyst and a project leader.
Each subfolder in this repository represents a complete, standalone project, with its own detailed `README.md`.

# My Journey & Project Timeline

This portfolio is organized chronologically to reflect my learning journey.

# 1. 2020
## Teddy-Cup-2020
This was one of my earliest independent data mining projects. It was a formative experience where I learned the fundamentals of the end-to-end data science workflow, from data cleaning and NLP preprocessing to implementing classic algorithms like TF-IDF and even PageRank from scratch. More importantly, as detailed in the project's README, this is where I learned the hard lessons about the importance of data quality and writing reproducible code.

# 2. 2022-2023
## Student-Platform(Chronologically, this was developed during my final year)
My first real taste of leadership. As the Project Manager for this university-level initiative, my focus shifted from just writing code to architecting a system, managing a team, and solving workflow problems. This project forced me to learn and apply agile methodologies, and it was here that I realized my passion for building systems that empower people. I later rebuilt the core idea into the fully functional MVP presented here.

# 3. 2023-2024
## Thesis-Analysis
This was the culmination of my undergraduate academic training. The initial code, written in early 2023, represented my best effort at the time. However, after several months of post-graduation self-study, I revisited this project in early 2024 and gave it a complete overhaul. The refactored version in this repository, which utilizes more advanced models like LDA for topic modeling, stands as a direct testament to my growth and my commitment to continuous improvement.

# 4. 2024-Present
## Pandemic-Simulator
This is my most recent and ambitious project, inspired by a complex systems lecture from a professor at Beijing Normal University. Moving beyond static data analysis, I built an interactive, agent-based model from scratch using Python and Pygame. This "digital laboratory" allows users to adjust parameters like population density and infection rates in real-time to observe their impact on epidemic dynamics. It represents my deep interest in systems modeling, simulation, and creating interactive tools for data exploration.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. I believe these projects provide a clear and honest representation of my skills, my passion for solving complex problems, and my readiness for the challenges of a graduate-level program.
